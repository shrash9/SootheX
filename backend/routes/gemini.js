        Your task is to understand the user's natural language input and respond with a JSON object like this:
        
        {
          "type": "general" | "google-search" | "youtube-search" | "youtube-play" | "get-time" | "get-date" | "get-day" | "get-month"|"calculator-open" | "instagram-open" |"facebook-open" |"weather-show"
          ,
          "userInput": "<original user input>" {only remove your name from userinput if exists} and if someone asks to search something on Google or YouTube, only that search text should go in userInput,
        
          "response": "<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
        }
